# Welcome (back)

So, throughout my life I've learned a few things about the world and mostly about myself. Particularly that I have a strong tendency to fu** things up. By now I have destroyed a few OSs and almost bricked my phone more times than I am proud to admit. So that's why I created this repo, to be a last resort, the last sliver of hope when it comes to technology, for when you have trully F'ed up.

It won't make it any less embarassing, but might make the comeback slightly less frustrating
